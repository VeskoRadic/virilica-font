# Changelog

## 27. 2. 2021.

Font points are rounded to integral values. Previously, due to the author's oversight when generating the font, this was not the case.

## [0.2] - 25. 10. 2020.

Completely covered Unicode basic latin and cyrillic blocks. Also, a somewhat expanded set of glyphs in font. Several characters have alternative variants.

### Changed

All the glyphs that existed were reworked.

## [0.1] - Some fifteen years ago, unpublished?

Cyrillic, numbers and basic characters.
